Demo of Antennas Selection
===========================
This code was taken from the webinar, *Quantum Programming with the Ocean Tools Suite*.

A graph representing antenna coverage. Each of the seven nodes below represent seven
different antennas with some amount of coverage. The edges between each node represent
antennas with overlapping coverage.

Problem: Given the above set of antennas, which antennas should you choose such that
you maximize antenna coverage without any overlaps?

Solution: The red antennas below are the ones that you should choose.
